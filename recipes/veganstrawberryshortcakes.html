        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            We tested vegan shortcakes with tough, crumbly biscuits and soupy, bland dairy-free cream.
            We started with our great Savory Drop Biscuits and added 2 tablespoons of sugar
            and a final sprinkling of turbinado sugar. Coconut milk whipped just like heavy cream
            into velvety billows, and its mild coconut flavor complemented the sweet strawberries
            and rich biscuits.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            FOR THE STRAWBERRIES: Using potato masher, mash one-third of strawberries with sugar
            in bowl. Stir in remaining strawberries, cover, and let sit while making biscuits,
            at least 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            FOR THE SHORTCAKES: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees.
            Set rimmed baking sheet in second baking sheet and line with parchment paper.
            Whisk flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together
            in large bowl. Whisk coconut milk, melted oil, and lemon juice together (oil will clump)
            in second bowl. Stir milk mixture into flour mixture until just incorporated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using greased â…“-cup dry measuring cup, drop level scoops of batter 1.5 inches apart
            on prepared sheet. Sprinkle evenly with turbinado sugar. Bake until tops are golden,
            12 to 14 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Transfer biscuits to wire rack
            and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Split each biscuit in half and place bottoms on individual plates. Using slotted spoon,
            portion strawberries over biscuit bottoms, then top with dollop of whipped cream.
            Top shortcakes and serve immediately.
        </li>
