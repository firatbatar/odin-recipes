<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    We first looked to the gravy. Saut√©ing umami-rich mushrooms and tomato paste with onion and garlic created lots of flavor-boosting fond; 
    we then deglazed the pan with Madeira wine before adding the broth. This gravy gave us a backbone of meaty flavor, 
    but the biggest key to success was using vegan protein crumbles. When cooked in our gravy, they added depth and an appealing chew. 
    For the topping, we whipped up some mashed potatoes, adding almond milk for creaminess. Using a fork, we created ridges in the potato topping 
    that would brown under the broiler.

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Cover potatoes with water in large saucepan. Add 1 tablespoon salt,
        bring to simmer over medium-high heat, and cook until potatoes
        are tender, 8 to 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Drain potatoes and return to now-empty saucepan. Using potato masher, 
        mash potatoes until smooth, then stir in milk, 1/4 cup oil, and chives. 
        Season with salt and pepper to taste; cover and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in broiler-safe 10-inch skillet over medium
        heat until shimmering. Add onion, mushrooms, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook
        until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and garlic and cook until
        bottom of skillet is dark brown, about 2 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Stir in Madeira and cook, scraping up and browned bits, until evaporated, about 1 minute.
        Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Stir in broth, carrots, Worcerstershire, thyme, and
        bay leaf and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Reduce heat to medium-low
        and simmer gently until carrots and mushrooms are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
        Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf, stir in protein crumbles, and season with salt
        and pepper to taste.
    </li>
    <li>
        Adjust oven rack 5 inches from broiler element and heat broiler.
        Transfer mashed potatoes to 1-gallon zipper-lock bag, seal top, and
        snip off bottom corner to make 1-inch opening. Pipe potatoes evenly over filling
        to cover. Smooth potatoes with back of spoon, then make ridges over surface with fork.
        Place skillet on rimmed baking sheet and broil until potatoes are golden
        and crusty, 5 to 10 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.
